# Notes for creating your Profile README

Here are some resources to help you create your Profile README:

1. YouTube video [GitHub Profile Readme](https://youtu.be/KhGWbt1dAKQ) by Adrian Twarog.
1. YouTube videos on GitHub Profile Reviews by Eddie Jaoude such as [Your open source GitHub repos / profiles shoutouts and reviews](https://youtu.be/xsZIKzE7gy8). There good examples to pull from.
1. Google search for `github profile generator` which is a good way to get the code for your stats. Just make sure to customize the markdown as you see fit.

## Video notes (Adrian Twarog)

- Create a repository with the name that is the same as your account name. THAT IS A MUST - IT MUST MATCH YOUR ACCOUNT NAME EXACTLY.
- Set it to be public and initiate it with a README file.
- Click edit on that README.md file and delete everything inside of it.
- Start including your markdown or copy code from other profile README files that you like.
- You want an intro paragraph, skills and languages you are studying, experience, links to articles you wrote, links to certifications, etc.
- You can search GitHub for README stats or use Google to find sites that will create the code for you.

## Example code

You can use `align="center"` on HTML tags like `h2`, `div`, `img`, and `p` tags:

```
<h1 align="center"><ins>JIM KERNICKY</ins></h1>
```

Here is code for HTML5 in my SKILLS section icon:

```
<img src="https://img.icons8.com/color/48/000000/html-5.png"/>
```

Find the code for the languages and technologies you use from other profiles and add the code into your profile. And of course use the markdown from this repo to structure your README.

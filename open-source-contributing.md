# Open Source & Contributing Notes

## Open Source

Notes from Eddie Jaoude & freeCodeCamp

- Labels: used to find your repos -  need issues with labels – javascript, 
- review other people’s Prs to see what they do
- find gist: https://gist.github.com/username/ 
- Must have elements in all OS projects:
1. License: If a project does not have an open-source license, then it is not open source
   1. The license helps protect contributors and users. Businesses and savvy developers usually won't touch a project without this protection: https://choosealicense.com/ 
1. README file: explains how to get started with a project. It lists the requirements for contributing to the project 
   1. A good README should contain everything a potential contributor would want to know about the project
1. Contribution Guidelines: These are guidelines that help people who contribute to the project know exactly what is expected from them: [Contributor guidelines template](https://opensource.com/life/16/3/contributor-guidelines-template-and-tips)
1. Code of Conduct: a document that establishes your expectations for how your contributors and participants behave: [Code of Conduct](https://opensource.guide/code-of-conduct/)
- Issue Tracker – a contributor can create an issue and link it to a pull request and fellow contributors can opt in to try and fix it
- Pull Requests - tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with the collaborator and add follow-up commits before the're merged into the base branch
- do everything on the insights tab to make sure your repos are good

Places to find contributions: 1) https://www.firsttimersonly.com/, 2) https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions, 3) https://github.com/tobie/specref, 4) https://github.com/github/docs, 5) find new issues: https://github.com/indeedeng/Mariner-Issue-Collector, 6) https://github.com/odoo/odoo, 7) https://github.com/Kibo/AstroChart, 8) https://github.com/AstroDraw/AstroChart, 9) https://github.com/iedr/goodfirstissues, 10) https://24pullrequests.com/ , 11) https://www.codetriage.com/

How to choose an Open-Source Project
- 1) check if it has a license, 2) check the date of the last commit (is it recent?), 3) check the # of contributors, 4) how often do they make commits?
- Also, look for: 1) open issues, 2) time for maintainers to respond, 3) are there active discussions, 4) are issues closed regularly, 5) are there open pull requests
- search: `is:open is:issue archived:false label:"good first issue" language"javascript"`
- Another Tip: search the project for “To Do” or “ToDo” or “To-Do”- they often get forgotten about – find one, raise an issue, then fix it

How to make money from open source: github now has a sponsorship – people can sponsor and github doesn’t take anything but they can match it

TAGS:
- a tag/release is where you are happy with the state of the project – it means it is a production ready asset – a tag is made up of multiple comits b\tw tags – or they are after commits, a save point – and a tag is a collection of commits

Miscellaneous:
- config.yml: yml files start w\ 3 dashes and end w\ 3 dots which allows you start and stop the the yaml data and allows you to have multiple in one file – though the ending 3 dots are optional – you have key-value pairs – values can be strings, integers, floats, booleans, arrays, lists and dictionaries – use the vscode extension YAML
- can be .yml or .yaml – both are good – yaml can detect strings so you don’t actually need the quotes but you need quotes when you have numbers/integer that needs to be interpreted as a string 
- for lists use an slight index and a dash then space like markdown
- the dictionary data type has elements that have elements (Attibutes) inside it – or more importantly you can do nesting
- it’s important to have some pull requests and issues - and branches greater than 1 – main/master, develop, feature1, feature2, … but not more than 9,
- open source is more about communication and collaboration 
- README – can include technologies needed to run the app like node or MySQL – what is the goal of the project, why it is important, why people should get involved
- for license look at https://choosealicense.com/
